This as an MVC version of the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T359598">T359598 - ASPxGridView - How to update an associated column editor in the Edit Form when the GridViewDataComboBoxColumn editor value is modified</a> code example. A custom callback to the server is handled via the <strong>jQuery.ajax</strong> function (e.g., see <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E4063">E4063 - How to use the jQuery.ajax function with DevExpress MVC Extensions</a>)<br><br>Note that we have used the techniques from the following webpages in this example:<br><br><a href="https://documentation.devexpress.com/#AspNet/CustomDocument9941">Passing Values to a Controller Action through Callbacks</a> <br><a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/T191698">T191698 - How to isolate extension settings into separate helper class and share a single partial view to display multiple extensions</a> <br><br>Actual updating of the underlying datasource is not implemented in this example. Please review the <a href="https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/p/E3983">E3983 - GridView - How to edit in memory data source</a> code example if you are interested in this scenario.
